# Sky Industrialization


Sky Industrialization is an Addon mod for [Modern Industrialization](https://modrinth.com/mod/modern-industrialization) by Technic4n aiming to add recipes that make it possible to run a SkyBlock world.

## Planned Features:

- Wood tier machines
  - Wooden Sifter
  - Wooden Sluice Box
  - Wooden Drier
  - Wooden Hand Crank
  - Wooden Hopper
 
- Early Game Ore Generation and Processing (still debating)

  - In the Crafting Grid you will be able to get certain metal nuggets by using a Sieve item, early game will be the usual Vanilla Minecraft ones (Gold, Iron...) and once you get your first bucket you will be able to access more recipes with MI's nuggets (Tin, Copper, Nickel, Silver...) 
You can also get Coal this way

  - Wooden Sluice Box, there really is not much to this one, you just right click with gravel and you get random nuggets.

## Where to Find Me: 
You can find me on Discord s3bas_08 (I have got a cute Sylveon pfp :D)
